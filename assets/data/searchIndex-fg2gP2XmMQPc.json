In 2021, 2% of all infants born in the United States were conceived using ART. While there areother methods of ART, IVF is by far the most common, representing 99% of ART procedures performed.","Many different people may opt to grow their families via IVF, including those with infertility diagnoses or existing health conditions, LGBTQIA+ couples, those who have previously frozen their eggs and sperm, and single parents.","Including prescriptions, bloodwork, and genetic testing, a single cycle of IVF can cost up to $30,000 without health insurance coverage, and it takes the average person 2.5 cycles to achieve pregnancy. As such, insurance coverage for IVF treatments often determines if people needing fertility treatment are able to afford to grow their families or not.","Since federal law does not require any health plans to cover infertility treatments, these services are left up to individual states. Many states still consider in vitro fertilization treatments to be \"boutique\" or \"elective\"reproductive medicine, despite often being the only tenable option for LGBTQIA+ couples, single parents, and people with a diagnosis of infertility. Even if state insurance laws offer infertility coverage, IVF coverage can still vary greatly from state to state.","IVF involves retrieving eggs from ovaries and manually combining them with sperm in a lab for fertilization, after which the fertilized egg known as the embryo is placed inside the uterus. The process begins with suppressing the menstrual cycle and stimulating egg production before the egg retrieval, also known as oocyte retrieval. Once the eggs are collected, they are combined with sperm from either the partner or a donor and become embryos, which can then be transferred back to the uterus. Any additional suitable embryos can be frozen for future IVF attempts.","Medical conditions that may necessitate IVF include blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, endometriosis, and unexplained infertility.","IVF differs from intrauterine insemination (IUI), where sperm is injected directly into the uterus. Since IUI is less invasive and less expensive, many people opt to start there; however, due to its lower success rate, many people who try IUI first then go on to seek IVF treatment.","Many factors can affect IVF success rates. Since the quality of eggs and sperm deteriorates as people get older, reproductive age has a negative correlation with IVF success. Other important factors include prior successful pregnancies, a smooth embryo transfer, maintaining a healthy weight, and abstaining from smoking and alcohol.","In addition to the financial implications, IVF can often cause serious physical and emotional strain for families. The synthetic hormones in the ovulation-stimulating fertility drugs can cause intense PMS, weight changes, headaches, and nausea. Moreover, many of these drugs need to be injected, often for weeks at a time. Beyond physical discomfort, the process can be incredibly emotionally taxing and stressful.","The impact of these stressors seeps into all aspects of life, including the workplace. Nearly nine out of 10 employees feel their fertility challenges significantly impacted their productivity at work and 50% say it decreases their job satisfaction. Moreover, nearly one in five employees end up leaving their jobs because of the impact of fertility treatment.","The cost of one IVF cycle ranges from $12,000 to $14,000, not including components of the process that clinics treat as add-ons to that base fee. While the clinic's base fee often includes monitoring appointments, bloodwork, and egg retrieval, it may not cover the injectable hormones, which can cost an additional $3,000 to $6,000. Other additional charges include genetic testing, trial transfers, cryostorage for unused embryos, donor sperm, or medical or hospital expenses.","Including these additional services—many of which may be necessary and required—the total bill for a single round of IVF typically ranges between $23,000 and $30,000. Considering that many people need more than one IVF cycle to achieve pregnancy, these costs quickly become prohibitive.","Infertility treatment coverage can make IVF more accessible and affordable, preventing people from going into debt or forgoing building their family altogether. As such, employers can play a key role in removing barriers to access. The business case for employers to support their employees as they start or grow their families is clear. While infertility insurance helps to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, other business advantages include better employee retention, recruiting better talent, and improved employee morale.","As of September 2023, 21 states and the District of Columbia have passed fertility insurance coverage laws. Only 15 of those laws include IVF coverage, and 17 laws cover fertility preservation services for iatrogenic, or medically-induced, infertility.","Even in these states, employers may not be required to cover infertility treatment and fertility preservation services if they’re self-insured, or if they have fewer than 50 employees and are not required to provide health insurance coverage. Religious organizations may also be exempt.","Another distinction between these state insurance laws is the difference between a mandate to cover and a mandate to offer. In mandated coverage laws, health insurance companies must provide coverage for infertility services in every policy, whereas mandated offer laws only require insurance companies to make this coverage available for purchase.","Only 11 states require both IVF and fertility preservation coverage: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington D.C.","Massachusetts and Arkansas have mandated IVF coverage but not fertility preservation coverage, which would include freezing eggs, sperm, and embryos. California and Texas are mandate-to-offer states, meaning health insurance plans must have an infertility insurance option but are not required to provide it in any or all plans.","In Colorado, all large group (100+ employees) health benefit plans must cover up to three completed egg retrievals with unlimited embryo transfers. This Colorado law also specifies that fertility medications must be treated as all other prescription medications.","New York has similar legal requirements for all large group health plans to cover up to three IVF cycles and prescription medications, with an added clause that prohibits insurance coverage discrimination based on age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, or gender identity.","Even the definition of what constitutes infertility varies significantly from state to state. For a comprehensive breakdown of fertility coverage laws by state, visit RESOLVE, the national infertility association.","Even among the 21 states and D.C. that have some sort of state-specific infertility treatment legislation, many of them are restrictive and discriminatory.","For example, Arkansas law stipulates that a patient's eggs must be fertilized with her partner's sperm, thus excluding LGBTQIA+ couples and single parents, a stipulation that persists in other states including Texas and Hawaii.","Further, these state laws often do not apply to self-insured plans, which cover 61% of workers in the U.S. The remaining 29 states do not require private insurance to cover any fertility services.","Privacy","Mon–Wed: 8am–6pm","Thu: 8am–5:30pm","Sat–Sun: Closed","© NeurOS Platforms Inc. 2025"],"codeblock":[],"url":"/blog/in-what-states-is-ivf-covered-by-insurance-a-comprehensive-guide-for-hr-leaders"},"/blog/nancy-s-maven-story-finding-empowerment-and-confidence-on-the-menopause-journey":{"version":1,"title":"Nancy’s Maven story: Finding empowerment and confidence on the menopause journey - My Framer Site","description":"BetterMedical: Your Trusted Healthcare Framer Template.

Shockingly, only 20 percent of OB-GYN residency programs offer formal menopause training, and 80 percent of OB-GYN residents report feeling \"barely comfortable\" discussing or treating menopause.","Nancy, an employee at a leading financial services company, was in desperate need of support as she navigated the challenges brought on by menopause. “The emotions... Holy moly, they were so bad. I was on this emotional rollercoaster between being happy, as I usually am, to sad, then mad.”","That’s when she found out she had access to Maven through her employer—a discovery that ended up being a turning point on her menopause journey. Maven’s holistic approach to menopause provided Nancy with the compassionate support she needed. “My Maven Mental Health Provider made me look at things in a different perspective, which really helped me. I couldn't believe just looking at it differently, it made everything better.”","Maven’s impact on mental health is reflected in the numbers: 50 percent of Menopause members seek support for managing anxiety and/or depression, with 45 percent reporting reduced depressive moods and 55 percent experiencing reduced anxiety after meeting with a Maven OB-GYN.","Menopause symptoms don’t just affect emotional well-being—they also disrupt work productivity and focus. Nancy experienced this firsthand. “It really takes a toll on you. At work, I just felt like I couldn't get stuff done. I felt like I wasn't focused. It was just amazing how it disrupts your entire life, no matter what you're doing.”","The constant cycle of hot flashes and sleep disturbances further complicated her daily routine. “You’re tired, you have no energy, because the hot flashes are waking you up in the middle of the night—you might get a little bit of sleep, and then you're hot, and then you go back to sleep again, and then you're hot again, and then you're freezing. It's a nightmare.”","Global productivity losses due to menopause exceed $150 billion annually, and approximately 20 percent of menopausal employees in the U.S. have considered leaving their jobs due to severe symptoms.

While physical health has always been a focus, with many employers offering health insurance and other wellness benefits, there's now a growing awareness of the importance of mental health in the workplace.","More than three-quarters of U.S. workers report at least one symptom of a mental health condition, and 84% say their work environment has contributed to at least one mental health challenge.","Many employers are realizing that supporting employee mental health can lead to happier teams and increase productivity. While 71% of workers believe their employer is more concerned about employee mental health than they were in the past, there is still more that can be done to improve workplace mental health.","Let’s explore some of the most effective mental health programs that companies can offer. By understanding these programs, you can better support your employees and create a healthier, more positive work environment.","Employee mental health is a crucial aspect of overall workplace well-being. It affects not only individual employees but also the productivity and success of the entire organization. Recognizing mental health issues and understanding their causes is key to planning and implementing an effective program to support employee mental health.","Many factors can impact employee mental health. Workplace issues, such as discrimination, excessive workloads, unsocial work hours, burnout, and low job control, can be a primary reason for a decline in employees' mental health. However, mental issues can also be a result of life events and other circumstances such as bereavement, family issues, financial difficulties, or navigating infertility.","Mental health issues significantly affect workplace productivity. One systematic review found that employee stress alone costs the economy $187 billion, with 70-90% of these losses stemming from a decline in productivity. Other research indicates that workers with fair or poor mental health are estimated to have nearly 12 days of unplanned absence each year, equating to $47.6 billion annually in lost productivity.","Employees experiencing mental health issues may find it difficult to concentrate, make decisions, or complete tasks efficiently. Depression, for instance, disrupts an employee's ability to complete physical job tasks about 20% of the time and reduces cognitive performance approximately 35% of the time.","This is also particularly true for mental health issues related to reproductive health, such as postpartum depression or anxiety surrounding fertility treatments, which can be both physically and emotionally draining. 55% of peoplefeel infertility is more stressful than unemployment, with 75% saying it strongly impacted their productivity. Infertility can affect employee productivity in a multitude of ways including fatigue, loss of concentration, and a lack of engagement with their team.","Effective mental health programs can greatly enhance employee well-being and morale. This is because when employers provide assistance and support employees, employees are more likely to be engaged and motivated at work.","Supporting employee mental health can also reduce absenteeism and turnover rates. Employees who have access to mental health resources are less likely to take time off due to their mental health. For example, employees who use an employee assistance program (EAP) report 52% fewer absences than those who do not. Research also shows 73% of employees and 81% of managers say they would be more likely to stay at a company that offered high-quality mental health resources.","A strong commitment to mental health can also enhance a company’s reputation and make it more attractive to top talent. Job seekers today often look for employers who prioritize their employees' mental well-being, with 81% of workers stating that how employers support employee mental health will be an important consideration when looking for a new role.","Successful employee mental health benefits are built on a foundation of proactive and comprehensive support. These programs aim to address mental health from multiple angles, ensuring employees have the resources and environment they need to thrive.","Regular mental health check-ups are essential for early detection and prevention of mental health issues. Just like physical health screenings, these assessments help identify problems before they become severe, allowing for timely intervention.","Various tools and methods can be used to conduct mental health assessments, including employee surveys, one-on-one interviews, and digital mental health apps. These tools can provide valuable insights into employees' mental health and help tailor support to individual needs.","Ensuring employees have access to mental health professionals is crucial. This is especially important during significant life events, such as family planning or dealing with fertility issues. Employers can provide support through employee assistance programs, short-term counseling or on-site counselors.","Alternative counseling methods, like virtual therapy sessions, support groups and mental health hotlines, can help employees to access the care they need at convenient times. For example, 35% of Maven members' appointments occur outside of standard doctor's office hours.","Additional resources for specific mental health concerns and situations can further tailor support to meet the diverse needs of your workforce. 34% of people, for instance, would like their employer to provide fertility counseling for employees who are struggling with their fertility.","Training programs that raise awareness about mental health issues are vital, yet 70% of senior-level employeessay they have received no training about how to talk to their team about mental health.","These programs educate employees and managers about recognizing signs of mental health struggles and how to respond appropriately, fostering a more understanding and supportive workplace. 83% of employees agree mental health and well-being training is, or would be, important in fostering a positive workplace culture. 36% feel managers should be trained on fertility issues and how to address conversations with colleagues.","Workshops that focus on stress management and resilience-building can also equip employees with practical tools to handle stress and maintain mental well-being. These sessions can include techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, and time management strategies.","Many studies indicate that a poor work-life balance is detrimental to health, with one revealing that nine in 10 women have experienced mental health issues as a result of a poor work-life balance. Implementing policies and creating a work environment that promotes work-life balance is essential for the mental health of employees.","This support could  offering flexible working hours, remote work options, and ensuring employees have adequate time off to recharge. For those going through fertility treatment, 77% say that flexible working to allow them to attend appointments would be beneficial.","A supportive work environment is one where employees feel comfortable discussing mental health issues without fear of stigma yet 75% of employers acknowledge the presence of stigma in their organization. Encouraging open conversations and providing support networks within the workplace can create a more inclusive and supportive culture.","Comprehensive health insurance plans that include mental health coverage are critical. This ensures employees can afford the health care they need without financial strain.","Beyond insurance, providing direct financial assistance for mental health treatments can make a significant difference. This can include subsidies for therapy sessions or covering costs for medications and other treatments.","Supporting mental health during family building is crucial, and recognizing the financial strain of fertility treatment is paramount to this. 78% of couples get into debt over fertility treatment and this has a detrimental impact on their mental health. To help alleviate this, 58% of people would like their employers to offer paid compassionate leave and 41% want financial support for fertility treatment.","Employers can partner with third-party vendors to offer specialized mental health services.

When employees are healthy and feeling their best, they will feel more engaged and loyal to their workplace. Likewise, when they feel appreciated and cared for, they’re able to do their best work without interruption. In fact, studies show that employers who provide wellness programs see a six-to-one return on their investment. These benefits are crucial to creating a positive workplace culture.","But as any HR leader knows, adding wellness programs doesn’t always mean your employees will use them, and not all benefits drive the same results. To build an effective employee wellness program, it’s crucial to understand how to measure their performance. Here’s a hint — it goes deeper than utilization. In this article, we’ll discuss the key leading indicators of successful employee wellness benefits, and how you can measure them in your organization.","Your wellness benefits likely consists of multiple, distinct wellness programs for the different needs and phases of life of your employees. In addition to health insurance, your package may include benefits for family building and pregnancy, mental health, physical health, childcare, retirement, and more. It may also include perks like fitness reimbursements, virtual care platforms, employee financial wellness programs, or even cheap prescription drugs.","To measure success, you first need to understand how each wellness program aims to help your employees. This can include improved employee engagement, improved employee loyalty, or even improved healthcare outcomes. When you know how each program intends to help, you can measure their outcomes against your baseline. This can include metrics like participation, engagement, and utilization, but also cost savings, employee satisfaction and retention, and even healthcare outcomes.","Tracking these metrics allows you to analyze the impact of you employee wellness programs, and make data-driven decisions about what your employees want, need, and will benefit the most from.","Although employee wellness benefits may target different aspects of health and wellness, there are generally five categories of metrics you can track to measure success.","The most obvious way to measure how well a wellness benefit is working is to look at how many eligible employees are actually signed up to use it. Generally speaking, if a lot of your employees are using something, it’s for a good reason. Most vendors will give you monthly or quarterly enrollment reports, especially if it’s a program where you pay per enrollment. But you can also run quarterly or annual benefits surveys and ask your employees which benefits they actually use.","Engagement is closely related to participation. It measures how many people use a benefit on a consistent basis, and to what extent they use it over a period of time. Whereas participation may tell you someone signed up for a wellness program, engagement tells you they’re actually using it. Engagement is closely correlated to business outcomes: a recent Gartner survey found that 48% of employees who use wellness programs are considered ‘highly engaged’ in their workplace.","Some employee wellness programs, like Maven, provide care that produces specific outcomes for people in your organization, including reducing ER visits, NICU admissions, or even C-section rates. Measuring these health outcomes usually requires some collaboration between your benefits provider, your health insurance, and your HR team. The health outcomes you track will vary depending on the service the benefit provides. For example, if you’re working with a virtual care provider, you would be looking for ways the benefit reduces hospital visits, improves access to care, or lowers healthcare costs.","Related: A leading life sciences company improves maternal health outcomes & lowers costs with Maven","Employee wellness, engagement, and satisfaction are all closely linked. Measuring employee satisfaction, especially as it relates to your wellness programs, can help you identify whether your benefits are sufficient for their needs, or if there are gaps you need to fill.","When surveying your employees during benefits evaluations or open enrollment, consider asking questions abouthow satisfied and engaged your employees are. You can also ask specific questions around your wellness program offerings to help connect your investments to their happiness.","Employee benefits are in many ways an investment. The dividends, however, are not always immediately apparent. But as a general rule of thumb, if your employees are healthier, they will use fewer healthcare resources. One way to measure how well they’re performing is to evaluate relevant cost savings, so you can better understand your ROI.","For wellness programs that target specific employee health outcomes, like mental health or physical health, you can look at year over year healthcare claims numbers to see if the benefit had an impact. You can also look to your employee retention numbers following a benefit’s rollout to get a sense of how it may have helped. As for a baseline, a recent SHRM report found that every dollar invested in health and wellness resulted in nearly six dollars returned in cost savings and productivity.","Privacy","Mon–Wed: 8am–6pm","Thu: 8am–5:30pm","Sat–Sun: Closed","© NeurOS Platforms Inc. 2025"],"codeblock":[],"url":"/blog/employee-wellness-program-metrics-key-indicators-and-how-to-measure-them"},"/blog/the-benefits-of-doulas-how-doulas-improve-employee-health-and-workplace-outcomes":{"version":1,"title":"The benefits of doulas: How doulas improve employee health and workplace outcomes - My Framer Site","description":"BetterMedical: Your Trusted Healthcare Framer Template.

Their support and expertise have been shown to improve labor and birth outcomes and reduce complications. By providing guidance and assistance in the postpartum period as well, doulas can ease an employee's transition back to work and provide invaluable emotional and mental support.","So how can employers facilitate these positive birth outcomes for their employees? A good place to start is by offering doula services as an employee benefit.","Doulas are trained professionals who provide continuous support and advocacy throughout the birthing process. Unlike midwives who are registered nurses, doulas aren't clinical professionals able to prescribe medicine, but they provide valuable physical and emotional support.","Doulas typically join the birthing person in their second or third trimester to answer questions about the birthing process and develop a birth plan. During labor, the doula can be present as a trained advocate to communicate with medical staff and facilitate comfort and support through touch and massage. Postpartum, doulas can help with breastfeeding education and offer practical support, teaching families how to care for their newborn baby.","Studies show that doula support reduces the need for C-sections and pain medication, thus leading to quicker and simpler recovery for birthing parents. Doula guidance has been shown to reduce premature deliveries and length of labor, and the emotional support they provide often reduces anxiety and stress, especially in the labor process.","By providing support in the first weeks after childbirth, postpartum doulas fill a critical and often neglected need, assisting new parents through the stress and overwhelm of this transition time.","While doulas commonly offer in-person care, virtual doula support has also been linked to improved birth outcomes and a more empowering birthing experience. In 2023, one in three U.S. counties were considered maternity care deserts, meaning they do not have a hospital or a birth center offering any obstetric care. It's estimated that nearly 7 million women live in these maternity care deserts. Especially for employees living in these areas, access to virtual doulas can fill care gaps and provide education and support that would otherwise not be accessible to them.","Virtual doula care has been shown to reduce the odds of C-sections for Maven members, with especially impactful results among Black Maven users specifically.
